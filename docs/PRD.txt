* Achieve over 90% adoption rate among incident commanders.
* Maintain high customer satisfaction scores (NPS ≥ 8.5) for incident communications.

## Users and Stakeholders

* **Incident Commanders**
* **Engineering Leads**
* **Customer Support Managers**
* **Marketing/Comms Team**

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: MVP

* **Incident Input Form**: severity, impacted services, customer impact, root cause, mitigation steps, ETA, message type, and tone.
* **AI Message Generation**: Leverage Flash-4 API to generate concise customer-facing updates.
* **Clarity and Tone Scoring**: Integrate Textstat for message clarity analysis.
* **Status Page Preview**: Mock-up resembling Abnormal's existing status page.
* **Download/Export Functionality**: Ability to download generated messages.

### Phase 2: Enhancement

* **Interactive AI Copilot**: Real-time collaboration and prompt refinement via chat-like interface.

* **Brand Alignment Scoring**: Automated scoring of generated messages against Abnormal’s tone guidelines.
* **Slack and Email Integration Previews**: Render messages formatted for internal Slack and external email.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

* **Real-Time Incident Timer**: Workflow simulation and urgency awareness during incidents.
* **Prompt Library**: Curated set of reusable templates (initial, ongoing, resolved notices).
* **Log Integration**: Auto-parsing and extraction from logs into structured fields.

## Technical Requirements

### Tech Stack:

* **Frontend**: Streamlit (MVP), ReactJS (Future phases)
* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI (future enhancements)
* **AI Integration**: Gemini Flash-4 API
* **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud (initial MVP), AWS or Vercel (advanced phases)
