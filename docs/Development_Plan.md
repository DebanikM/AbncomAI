| **Phase 2: Enhancement** | 2-4 weeks | Improved interaction | AI copilot, dynamic templates, brand alignment, multi-channel |
| **Phase 3: Advanced** | 4-6 weeks | Complete platform | Real-time timer, prompt library, log integration |

## Metrics & Success Indicators

| Metric | Phase 1 Target | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Time-to-message | 50% reduction | 65% reduction | 80% reduction |
| Adoption rate | 70% | 85% | 95% |
| Customer satisfaction | NPS ≥ 8.0 | NPS ≥ 8.5 | NPS ≥ 9.0 |
| Message quality | Manual review | Brand score >85% | Auto-approval >90% |

## Technology Evolution

| Component | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | React migration begins | TypeScript React |
| **Backend** | Python | FastAPI introduction | Full FastAPI implementation |
| **AI Model** | Gemini API | Enhanced prompting | Fine-tuned models |
| **Deployment** | Streamlit Cloud | AWS/Vercel planning | Production AWS with CI/CD |

## Resource Requirements

| Resource Type | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Engineering | 1 full-stack developer | 2 developers (frontend, backend) | 3 developers + DevOps |
| Design | Basic UI/UX | Dedicated UI/UX designer | UI/UX designer + user testing |
| AI/ML | Gemini API access | Enhanced prompt engineering | ML engineer for fine-tuning |
| Infrastructure | Minimal (cloud hosting) | Moderate (staging environment) | Complete production setup |
