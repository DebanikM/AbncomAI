Product Concept: AI-Enhanced Incident 
Management Communications 
Background & Context 
At Abnormal Security, we treat every customer-impacting incident with urgency, transparency, 
and professionalism. External customer communications are typically managed via Abnormal’s 
product status page. 
 
Our Incident Management process includes engineering response coordination, severity 
classification, and the creation of external communications that keep customers informed and 
reassured. These are manual tasks typically owned by Customer Support, Engineering, and 
Incident Commanders. These messages must strike the right balance of clarity, brevity, and 
technical accuracy while omitting irrelevant internal details. As a result, this process is 
time-intensive, error-prone under pressure, and inconsistent in tone and quality depending on 
the author. 
 
This manual approach introduces several risks: 
 
●  Delays in communication due to bottlenecks in drafting and review 
●  Inconsistencies in message tone and structure across incidents 
●  Potential for over-sharing or under-communicating key customer impacts 
●  Cognitive overhead for engineering teams during high-severity incidents 
meet our standards for speed, consistency, and professionalism. 
Task Assignment 
Your goal is to define an AI-native workflow that assists in generating succinct, accurate, and 
customer-appropriate incident communications. This solution should aim to: 
 
●  Reduce manual effort and response time during incidents 
●  Ensure consistent, on-brand, and compliant messaging 
●  Improve clarity around customer impact while minimizing internal noise 
●  Integrate seamlessly into our existing incident response workflows 
 
The output of this initiative should improve operational efficiency, reduce communication risk 
during incidents, and reinforce customer trust through high-quality, timely updates. 
 
Please create: 
-  A Product Requirements Document 
-  A working prototype demo of the proposed workflow, that is viewable by Abnormal via a 
web browser. 
-  A ~5 minute video recording of your proposal. Please describe how AI is utilized in the 
proposal, and how you used AI to develop the proposal.
