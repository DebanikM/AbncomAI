# AbComm AI - Progress Documentation

## Project Information
- **Project Name:** AbComm AI - Incident Messaging Assistant
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 - MVP
- **Start Date:** May 26, 2025

## Daily Progress Entries

### Day 1 - May 26, 2025

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Project initialization and repository setup
- [x] Created basic project structure following MVP requirements
- [x] Implemented Streamlit UI with incident input form
- [x] Developed Gemini API integration utilities
- [x] Implemented text analysis functionality for message quality scoring
- [x] Created message formatting templates
- [x] Added documentation (README, Progress Documentation)

#### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Integration with Gemini Flash-4 API requires proper error handling for API rate limits and timeouts.
  - **Solution:** Implemented robust error handling in the `gemini_utils.py` file to handle potential API issues gracefully.

- **Challenge:** Text analysis metrics needed to be normalized to provide meaningful scores.
  - **Solution:** Developed custom algorithms in `text_analysis.py` to convert raw metrics into 0-100 scale scores that are more intuitive for users.

#### Key Decisions
- Decided to use Streamlit for the MVP phase due to rapid development capabilities
- Implemented a modular architecture to separate concerns (UI, API integration, text analysis, formatting)
- Chose to use the Flesch Reading Ease score as the primary readability metric due to its widespread adoption and reliability

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing with actual API credentials
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback on the UI and generated messages
- [ ] Fine-tune prompt engineering for optimal message generation
- [ ] Enhance the status page preview to more closely match Abnormal's actual status page
- [ ] Prepare for user acceptance testing
