# AbComm AI – Phase 3: Advanced Features Documentation

## Overview
Phase 3 introduces sophisticated capabilities that transform AbComm AI from a message generation tool into a comprehensive incident communication platform. This phase is scheduled to begin after Phase 2 review with an estimated timeline of 4-6 weeks.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Incident Timer
- **Functionality:** Workflow simulation and urgency awareness during incidents
- **Implementation:**
  - Integrated countdown timer with alerting mechanisms
  - Automatic message update suggestions based on elapsed time
  - Visual indicators for response SLAs and deadlines
- **Benefits:**
  - Create appropriate urgency during incident response
  - Ensure timely customer updates based on incident duration
  - Track and analyze communication response times

### 2. Prompt Library
- **Functionality:** Curated set of reusable templates for different incident scenarios
- **Implementation:**
  - Template database organized by incident type, severity, and stage
  - Template editor for incident commanders to create and save custom templates
  - AI-assisted template suggestion based on incident characteristics
- **Benefits:**
  - Institutional knowledge capture around effective communications
  - Reduced cognitive load through standardized starting points
  - Continuous improvement of message templates

### 3. Log Integration
- **Functionality:** Auto-parsing and extraction from logs into structured fields
- **Implementation:**
  - Integration with Abnormal's logging systems
  - AI-powered extraction of relevant incident details
  - Automatic population of incident form fields from logs
- **Benefits:**
  - Dramatic reduction in manual data entry
  - Improved accuracy of incident details
  - Faster generation of initial communications

## Technical Specifications

### Tech Stack Evolution
- **Frontend:** Complete migration to ReactJS with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Expanded FastAPI implementation with async processing
- **AI Integration:** Enhanced use of Flash-4 with fine-tuning on Abnormal-specific data
- **Deployment:** Production-grade deployment on AWS with CI/CD pipeline
